I use Dataset Diabetes from BRFSS in Kaggle. Why i choice this dataset?

First, Diabetes is among the most prevalent chronic diseases in the United States, impacting millions of Americans each year and exerting a significant financial burden on the economy. Diabetes is a serious chronic disease in which individuals lose the ability to effectively regulate levels of glucose in the blood, and can lead to reduced quality of life and life expectancy. After different foods are broken down into sugars during digestion, the sugars are then released into the bloodstream. This signals the pancreas to release insulin. Insulin helps enable cells within the body to use those sugars in the bloodstream for energy. Diabetes is generally characterized by either the body not making enough insulin or being unable to use the insulin that is made as effectively as needed.

The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is a health-related telephone survey that is collected annually by the CDC. Each year, the survey collects responses from over 400,000 Americans on health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and the use of preventative services. It has been conducted every year since 1984. For this project, a csv of the dataset available on Kaggle for the year 2015 was used. This original dataset contains responses from 441,455 individuals and has 330 features. These features are either questions directly asked of participants, or calculated variables based on individual participant responses.

I Found This dataset from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/diabetes-health-indicators-dataset

File Dataset diabetes _ 012 _ health _ indicators _ BRFSS2015.csv is a clean dataset of 253,680 survey responses to the CDC's BRFSS2015. The target variable Diabetes_012 has 3 classes. 0 is for no diabetes or only during pregnancy, 1 is for prediabetes, and 2 is for diabetes. There is class imbalance in this dataset. This dataset has 21 feature variables

And The Creator Dataset make this dataset for use by other people has some exploration and research for Diabetes. Explore some of the following research questions:

Can survey questions from the BRFSS provide accurate predictions of whether an individual has diabetes?

What risk factors are most predictive of diabetes risk? Can we use a subset of the risk factors to accurately predict whether an individual has diabetes?

Can we create a short form of questions from the BRFSS using feature selection to accurately predict if someone might have diabetes or is at high risk of diabetes?

So, i just doing the exploration data, Normalitation data, Data Correlation, and some other method.
